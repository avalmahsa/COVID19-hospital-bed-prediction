# COVID19-hospital-bed-prediction

## Problem Description 
The goal was to create a predictive model that could estimate the number of beds left per country at a given future date, after first being trained on previously acquired data. Understanding a countryâ€™s hospital bed capacity is critical for resource allocation and for the implementation of mandates that can slow transmission to a sufficient rate. With this prediction, our following goal was to predict how the number of hospital beds will affect the COVID-19 fatality rate. This information will highlight the importance of hospital beds, and in turn, healthcare availability, during an infectious spread. Importantly, understanding the relationship between hospital bed capacity and virus fatality rate will help with healthcare preparation and response in the case of future outbreaks and new pandemics.
