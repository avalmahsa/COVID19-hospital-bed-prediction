# COVID19-hospital-bed-prediction:
- preprocessing and data exploration
- parameter search
- pipelining
- **models used**: Linear regression, Random forest, MLP, LSTM
- **software used**: Python (jupyter), KNIME, Tableau (for visualizations)
- **dataset**: dataset was patched using various sources: United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Worldbank.org, and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation
- **goal**: The COVID-19 pandemic has illuminated the necessity for predictive models to help improve resource allocation and emergency response systems. Predictive modeling may be utilised to help initiate pre-emptive measures to prevent devastating outcomes from an infectious spread. Keeping track of this data also ensures better financial planning for hospitals and allows hospitals to monitor what systems and regulations permit the highest quality and most efficient healthcare. 

The goal was to create a predictive model that could estimate the number of beds left per country at a given future date, after first being trained on previously acquired data. Understanding a countryâ€™s hospital bed capacity is critical for resource allocation and for the implementation of mandates that can slow transmission to a sufficient rate. With this prediction, my goal was to predict how the number of hospital beds will affect the COVID-19 fatality rate. This information will highlight the importance of hospital beds, and in turn, healthcare availability, during an infectious spread. Importantly, understanding the relationship between hospital bed capacity and virus fatality rate will help with healthcare preparation and response in the case of future outbreaks and new pandemics.
